# Algorithms & Data Structures
Algorithms and Data Structures 
help in understanding the nature 
of the problem at a 
deeper level and thereby
 a better understanding of the world. They are 
 also the key to efficient programming
 and good software design. The goal of this
  repository is to practice the implementation
   of common data structures and algorithms 
   in the simplest and elegant way with the 
   help of the course "Algorithms I" from 
   Princeton University (Coursera platform).
# Programming language
This repository will provide implementations 
in Java.
